Just practice writing declarative & reactive code :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

P.S. You can use `ng serve --no-live-reload` to prevent the page from auto-refreshing on any changes.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
